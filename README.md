# Title: Memory Game Project

## Author: Nwagwu Chijioke
## Table of Contents

## Purpose: 
* ### Upgrade to my Udacity Nanodegree matching game project based on the recomendation from my frien Wande.

* ### To display my ability to traverse and manipulate the DOM.

* ### To showcase my web development skillset.




## How the Game Works
 The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
